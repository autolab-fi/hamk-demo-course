    "shortCourseName": "HAMK Remote Mobile Robot Lab",
    "shortDescription": "Pilot HAMK’s ESP32-based mobile robots remotely and learn MicroPython control, sensing, and autonomy in a 24/7 online lab.",
    "fullDescription": "Step into HAMK’s always-on mobile robotics laboratory and drive a real ESP32-powered differential-drive robot over Wi‑Fi. The platform pairs MicroPython firmware with motor drivers, encoders, line sensors, and LEDs on a modular chassis that runs on a camera-monitored test track. You’ll learn to script movement, read sensors, stream telemetry, tune PID line-following, and deploy remote experiments confidently from anywhere.",
