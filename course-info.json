    "fullDescription": "Experience the limited-access demo of HAMK’s always-on mobile robotics laboratory and drive a real ESP32-powered differential-drive robot over Wi‑Fi. The platform pairs MicroPython firmware with motor drivers, encoders, line sensors, and LEDs on a modular chassis that runs on a camera-monitored test track. You’ll learn to script movement, read sensors, stream telemetry, tune PID line-following, and deploy remote experiments confidently from anywhere.",
