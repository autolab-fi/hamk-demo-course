# Lesson 1. Test drive

## Objective

Get started with the rover and set it in motion promptly.

## Introduction

In this mission, you will learn how to initiate movement in the rover. It's not a complex task; all you need is a strong desire and perseverance.

Behold the mighty rover who will assist you in learning.

Now let's test the rover by writing a program for forward movement.

## Mission Control Interface

Before you begin coding, take a moment to familiarize yourself with the workspace.

1.  **Red Box:** This area contains the lesson instructions which you need to read and follow along.
2.  **Yellow Box:** This is the Code Editor where you will write your mission code.
3.  **White Box:** This is the terminal where you will get details about the assignment verification status.
4.  **Blue Box:** This shows the live video of the rover, which will be executing your code.
    * *Note: Sometimes the video may take time to load, just be patient.*
5.  **Red Arrow:** The **Verify** button. You will use this to upload your code to the rover.

## Instructions

1. Copy the code provided below and paste it into the code editor (Yellow Box).

```python
rover.move_forward_seconds(3)
```
2.Upload the program to the rover.(See the animation below: Write your code, press "Verify," and view the results.)

3.Observe the program execution results in the output and on the video feed.

## Conclusion
Wasn't hard, was it? A tiny code though a giant leap towards building your robotics skillset. You have successfully acquired the skill to make the rover move. Now, you can proceed to the next mission!
